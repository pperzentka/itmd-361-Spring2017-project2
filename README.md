Adding CSS to the project1


Requirements

   -  Multiple linked valid, well-formed semantic HTML files (Project 1, essentially).
   -  HTML-based fallbacks for any media elements (image, audio, video) that you include.
   -  One single valid, error-free CSS file. Do not create more than one single screen.css file for your project.
   -  Your HTML and CSS files should both be indented with 2 spaces or one tab per level of indent; indent all CSS style rules
      inside the declaring block, and further indent all rules and blocks inside your media queries.
   -  Open your CSS file with a set of reset styles (such as the minified Eric Meyer resets from class demos).
   -  Use of only relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS; no px, pt, or other absolute units allowed.
   -  Use at least two min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for larger screens.
   -  Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators, no Bootstrap or other
      off-the-shelf HTML or CSS frameworks).
   -  A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you
      make.
   - GitHub repository must contain only the files and commits from this project.
   - You are encouraged to use and further improve your HTML files from Project 1.
